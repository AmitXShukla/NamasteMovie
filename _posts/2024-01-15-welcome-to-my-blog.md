# Hello World! 🌍

This is my first blog post on my new Jekyll-powered website hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Why I Started This Blog

I wanted a simple place to share my thoughts, projects, and learnings. Jekyll + GitHub Pages makes it incredibly easy:

- Write posts in **Markdown**
- Push to GitHub
- Site is automatically built and deployed!

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

1. **Technology** - Programming tips, tutorials, and discoveries
2. **Projects** - Updates on what I'm building
3. **Learning** - Things I'm exploring and resources I find helpful

## A Quick Code Example

Here's a simple "Hello World" in multiple languages:

**Python:**
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

**JavaScript:**
```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

**Ruby:**
```ruby
puts "Hello, World!"
```

## Stay Tuned!

Thanks for visiting. Feel free to explore the site and [get in touch](/contact) if you want to connect!
